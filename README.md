CS 145 - Lab 6
Binary Search Dictionary Lab 6

Key topics: 
Printing, data types, methods, operators, expressions, variables, loops, recursion, parameters, returns, String objects, Scanner objects, and binary search trees 

Learning Outcomes: 
•	Continue to become familiar with setup, design, execution and testing of Java programs 
•	Design and develop a multi-class, multi-method program in good style 
•	Demonstrate your understanding of recursion 
•	Apply tools and techniques introduced in class to create a working program 
•	Demonstrate your understanding of binary search trees

Task: 
Your task is to create a dictionary using a binary search tree to do an employee, customer, or member lookup.  You may use either recursion or iteration to implement this data structure.  
Your BST should give the user the option to use either pre-order, in-order, and post-order searches.  You will name the file <fi><li>Dictionary.java. 
You will be including this in your GitHub portfolio that you will show off to employers, so make it good.  
The database will start out empty, and each of the nodes will include first name, last name, street address, city, state, zip, e-mail, and phone number,
along with a primary key for doing search, add, modify, and deletes.  

Functional Rundown: 
Upon executing your program, the console should display a menu (add, delete, modify, lookup, list number of records.  You don’t need to worry about sorting or balancing the tree. 
Based on the user’s prompt, it should ask the user for the appropriate information and carry out the assigned tasks.   
For Adds, it should prompt the user for the appropriate primary key, along with user data.  The program should give the user confirmation about the data added.  
For Deletes, it should prompt the user for field to be deleted and confirm that the user wishes to delete this record.  It should also confirm that the user wishes to delete the record.  
For Lookups, you should give the user option of pre-order, in-order, or post order, and print out the appropriate values.   
For Modify, the user should be prompted on which field(s) should be modified along with confirmation.  


Creative Portion: 
In addition to the functionality of the calendar, your dictionary should display some text art (ACSII art) above the output. You have the freedom to choose what you display with these restrictions: 
•	The ACSII art must be your own creation, not something found on the internet or elsewhere.
•	The picture should be appropriate and not include hateful, offensive, or inappropriate images.
•	You should not use advanced material beyond what we have learned in class so far.
For this portion of the assignment, you will get credit for completing something that demonstrates you have put some effort into it.
If you follow the guidelines above and it is clear in your code that you have put in effort, you will receive full points for the creative portion of the assignment.
Don’t worry if you feel you are not particularly creative- something pretty basic will do as long as it meets the above requirements.

Implementation Details: 
You are free to choose the names of the classes, methods, variables, and constants.  Make sure that they follow the standard naming conventions covered in class. 
Be sure to include two to three classes, along with multiple methods for each class.
